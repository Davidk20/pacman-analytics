# Pac-Man Analytics

This Jupyter notebook analyses and visualizes the performance of various Pacman agents based on their gameplay data. The data includes metrics such as time taken, scores achieved, and states traversed during the game. The goal is to provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of different agents using various visualizations whilst also learning the basics of data visualisation and analytics. The data source is collected from my [Final Year Project](https://github.com/Davidk20/pacman-solutions-backend).


## Dataset

Due to the size constraints of GitHub, a reduced dataset has been uploaded. To make use of this dataset, follow the below steps:

1) Rename the file to `pacman_results.csv`
2) Inside the Setup section, change the `max_runs` value to `50`
